# Fetch Coding Exercise - Selenium Test Automation

## Project Overview
This Selenium WebDriver script is designed to automate the Fetch Coding Exercise. It identifies a fake gold bar from a set of bars by simulating the weighing process on a web application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Google Chrome Browser
- ChromeDriver compatible with your Chrome version
- Git (for cloning the repository, if applicable)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository :**
   To clone the repository, use the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ManitaPasi/FetchSDET.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Python Environment :**
   It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **ChromeDriver Setup**
   Ensure ChromeDriver is installed and its path is set in the script or system PATH.

## Running the Script

Execute the script from the command line:
```bash
python Fetch.py
```


## How It Works

The script performs the following actions:
1. Opens the web application in a Chrome browser.
2. Automates the weighing of gold bars.
3. Identifies the fake gold bar.
4. Interacts with web elements to confirm the detection.

## Output

The script will display an alert message and output the index of the fake gold bar, along with the sequence of actions performed.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all prerequisites are installed.
- Check the ChromeDriver path if there are browser interaction issues.
- Ensure internet connectivity for accessing the web application.
